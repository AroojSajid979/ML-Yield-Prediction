# ML Yield Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project predicts chemical reaction yields using Machine Learning.
The model estimates yield based on experimental parameters.

## Dataset
Features used in this project:
- TBAB_equiv
- Na2CO3_equiv
- Temperature
- Time
- Yield (target)

## Model Training
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.0
- Most important feature: Na2CO3_equiv

## Results
Actual vs Predicted Yield graph is used to evaluate model performance.
